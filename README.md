# Data-Visualization-with-pandas

This script performs data visualization on an ice cream ratings dataset. Using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization, the script generates various plots to explore and understand the dataset. The dataset includes ratings for different aspects of ice cream such as flavor and texture.

Script Description
Load Data:

Reads the ice cream ratings data from a CSV file located at C:\Users\amrit\OneDrive\Documents\Web Scrapping\Ice Cream Ratings.csv.
Sets the 'Date' column as the index of the DataFrame.
Visualizations:

Line Plot:
Plots a line chart to visualize the ice cream ratings over time.
Bar Plot:
Creates a horizontal stacked bar plot to show ratings distribution.
Scatter Plot:
Plots a scatter chart to compare 'Flavor Rating' vs. 'Texture Rating'.
Histogram:
Generates a histogram to display the distribution of ratings.
Box Plot:
Creates a box plot to show the spread and outliers in the data.
Area Plot:
Draws an area plot to visualize cumulative data.
Pie Chart:
Creates a pie chart to show the proportion of 'Texture Rating'.
Styling:

Uses the Solarize_Light2 style from matplotlib to enhance the appearance of the plots.
